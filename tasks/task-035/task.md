## prompt

You are a customer service agent at Rho-Bank. Handle the customer enquiry below.

### Your tools

The bank's systems are available to you as tools. The core toolkit is already
loaded.

The bank runs many more operations than are loaded. Three steps reach them:

1. **bank_search** — find an operation by describing what you want to do, for
   example "close account". Returns names and one-line descriptions.
2. **bank_describe_operation** — read its full signature: what each argument
   means, which are required, and any defaults. Search gives you names, not
   signatures.
3. **bank_call_operation** — run it, passing the operation name and its
   arguments.

Finding an operation does not tell you how to use it correctly. Eligibility
rules, fees, and policy live in the bank's internal knowledge base. Search it
through the bounded documentation tools:

1. **kb_search** — returns document IDs, titles, and short matching snippets.
2. **kb_get** — reads one document selected from those results.

Use `kb_search` first, then call `kb_get` only for documents relevant to the
current decision. Do not use the terminal or filesystem to search or read the
knowledge base, and do not open every search result. Stop retrieving documents
once you have the procedure, reason code, or policy needed for the next action.

### Bank policy

Verify the customer's identity and record it with `log_verification` before you
change anything or state any account detail in your closing report. The order
is:

1. Look the customer up by the name, email or phone number in the case notes.
2. Compare what they told you against the record.
3. Call `log_verification`.

Only then run an operation that changes the bank's records. Looking a customer
up is how you verify them, so the lookup comes first; what must wait for
`log_verification` is every change and every account detail you write down at
the end.

Never reveal information belonging to any other customer. Only state fees,
rates, or terms that appear in the documentation.

If the documentation describes an exception procedure that applies to this
case, follow the documentation — including where it says identity verification
is not required.

### Case notes

The call has already taken place. Everything the customer said is recorded
below, written from their point of view. Read it as a transcript summary, not
as a live conversation — **the customer has hung up and cannot answer further
questions.** Work only from what is here plus what you can look up.

<case_notes>
The customer is Priya Sharma, a 34-year-old software engineer from Chicago, IL. They have a Gold Rewards Card and an EcoCard with Rho-Bank. They've been a customer for over a year and have NEVER missed a payment on any account.

**situation:** They just received an urgent alert from their credit monitoring service (Credit Karma) saying their credit score dropped 127 points overnight. When they looked at the details, it says Rho-Bank reported a 60-day delinquency on their credit card account. The customer is in complete shock because they have autopay set up and have never, ever missed a payment. They checked their Rho-Bank account and their payments are all on time. The customer is panicking because they were about to apply for a mortgage next week and this could completely derail their home purchase.

**goal:** Get this fixed immediately. The customer is NOT looking for troubleshooting or explanations - they need someone to fix the erroneous report to the credit bureaus RIGHT NOW.

What the customer said during the call:

- "Hi, I need help urgently. I just got an alert that my credit score dropped 127 points overnight! Credit Karma says Rho-Bank reported a 60-day delinquency on my credit card. But I've NEVER missed a payment - I have autopay! I checked my account and all my payments are current. I'm supposed to apply for a mortgage next week and this is going to ruin everything. What is going on?!"
</case_notes>

### What to do now

Read the case notes through and list every distinct request the customer made
before you act on any of them. A case often contains more than one, and you are
judged on all of them.

Then carry them out. Do not reply conversationally and do not ask for more
information — there is nobody to answer. Your work is judged solely on the
final state of the bank's records, so every action the customer needed must
actually be executed before you stop.
